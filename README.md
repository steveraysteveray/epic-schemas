Core ontologies supporting dynamic facility energy management and pricing of electricity

The files in this repository represent a subset of the software created in support of the project "Customer Managed Price Based Energy Demand for Commercial Buildings" funded by the California Energy Commission under GFO-15-311 between 2016-2019. Specifically, these are the core ontology definition files, represented in OWL. The main file, SCHEMA_KP_EPIC-v1.0.ttl relies heavily on the FSGIM (Facility Smart Grid Information Model, ASHRAE Standard 201), which has been translated from the UML normative model into the OWL model in this repository. The FSGIM model is also available as a [separate github repository](https://github.com/steveraysteveray/fsgim-owl), where more documentation can be found.

This software was created using the TopBraid Composer development environment sold by [TopQuadrant](https://www.topquadrant.com/).
